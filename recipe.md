Aidan's Mom's Pumpkin Pie Recipe

by A. L. Feldman

* 2 cups of pumpkin pulp purée from a sugar pumpkin* or from canned pumpkin * purée
* 1 1/2 cup 2% milk or 1 12 oz. can of evaporated milk
* 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
* 1/3 cup white sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 eggs plus the egg white of a third egg
* 2 teaspoons of cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamon
* 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest
* 1 good crust (see pâte brisée recipe)

* To make pumpkin purée from a sugar pumpkin: start with a small-medium sugar pumpkin, cut out the stem and scrape out the insides, discard (save the seeds, of course). Cut the pumpkin in half and lay cut side down on a rimmed baking sheet lined with silpat or aluminum foil. Bake at 350°F until fork tender, about an hour to an hour and a half. Remove from oven, let cool, scoop out the pulp. (Alternatively you can cut the pumpkin into sections and steam in a saucepan with a couple inches of water at the bottom, until soft.) If you want the pulp to be extra smooth, put it through a food mill or chinois.
